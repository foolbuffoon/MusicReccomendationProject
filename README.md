## Text-Based Adventure Game
An OOP terminal based fantasy inspired text adventure.
The story takes place in a swamp, and our hero is tasked with defeating Slurok, a dark force exerting power over the swamp.

Gameplay consists of the player being given with two or multiple choices, and the game will react based on which choice the player makes

The game's combat also turn based, with three systems of player-monster interaction: Potions, Weapons and Spells.(Combat system still in development)
